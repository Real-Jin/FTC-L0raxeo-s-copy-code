/**
 * The OpMode class is the main base of operations.
 * FYI: Op is short for operation. Tele is short for telephone
 *      Telephone Operation
 *
 * The Operation Mode class holds all of the main
 * methods that are used to actually run the robot.
 * It's the origin (original place of where all of
 * the code you have written throughout the project
 * is invoked (called).
 *
 * {@link OpMode} is an abstract class that is inherited
 * by this class. This means that OpMode is an abstract
 * class. In simpler terms, extending to {@link OpMode}
 * is defining this class as a version of {@link OpMode}.
 *
 * Those @Override lines before each method (init, loop...)
 * are called tags, and are a result of this class extending
 * to {@link OpMode}. Those methods with the @Override tags
 * are automatically called by the {@link OpMode} abstract
 * class, and therefore you don't have to worry about them.
 *
 * This class also holds the instances of all of the main
 * objects within the robot's program such as the {@link DeviceMap}.

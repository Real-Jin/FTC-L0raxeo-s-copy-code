/**
 * Summary:
 * What is the device map?
 *
 * The Device Map stores all of the physical
 * devices within the physical robot, and defines
 * them as code. This device map can then be used
 * as a dictionary/backpack, that you can open
 * and use the devices inside of it.
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * The Devices themselves:
 * How are the physical devices actually mapped
 * (defined, put, created) inside of the device map?
 * All devices, are types of objects. And all objects
 * are just classes that can be declared and instantiated.
 *
 * When defining and creating an object in Java,
 * there are 2 different steps:
 * 1) Declaration - declaring an object is the process
 *    of stating that an object will exists, and what type
 *    of object it is. You can think of it as the blueprints
 *    of what the object is going to be, since declaring
 *    it doesn't mean you are creating it.
 *
 *    Ex: public DcMotor motor.
 *    Within the example stated above, there are
 *    three key terms- "public", "DcMotor", "motor".
 *
 *    The first term (public) is optional. It simply
 *    states whether the object you are declaring is
 *    accessible from outside of the class it resides
 *    in. It can be replaced with "private", in which
 *    case it would be inaccessible from outside the
 *    class.
 *
 *    The second term (DcMotor) is the object type.
 *    This states what the object you are creating
 *    actually is. In this case, the DcMotor is
 *    representing a physical Dc Motor. If it were
 *    representing a Servo, we would replace "DcMotor"
 *    with the word "Servo".
 *
 *    The third term (motor) is the name. The name
 *    must not contain any spaces, and it is the
 *    name that we will use to reference/use the
 *    object. If we want to modify the object, we
 *    will refer to it as "motor", not "DcMotor".
 *    However, the name can be whatever you prefer.
 *    The only constraint is that it must not contain
 *    spaces, or special symbols such as "%" or "$".
 *
 * 2) Instantiation - instantiating an object is
 *    when we actually create the object. It's called
 *    instantiation, because we are creating an instance
 *    of the object. The instance, is the object
 *    that we can manipulate, and use.
 *
 * In a nutshell, we map devices within the device
 * map by first declaring, and then instantiating.

     *
     * Code would normally be inside of the two
     * brackets ({}), but in this case there is none.
     * This means that the constructor doesn't actually
     * do anything.
